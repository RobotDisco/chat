* Rust Chat app
(tutorial websocket app from the tutorial  https://nbaksalyar.github.io/2015/07/10/writing-chat-in-rust.html)
** What it does
If you launch it, and then use a javascript app to connect to it, it will establish a connection!

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:10000');

if (ws.readyState == WebSocket.OPEN) {
    console.log('Connection is successful');
}
#+END_SRC
** How to run it
 1. Have the rust ecosystem installed on your computer (see https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
 2. Check out the code src_sh{git clone https://github.com/robotdisco/rust_chat}
 3. ~cargo build~
 4. ~cargo run~
 5. Launch a browser and use its dev tools to run the code block from the previous section! Enjoy :)
